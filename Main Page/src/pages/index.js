            <strong>JU eezy</strong> is a <b>platform</b> created to{' '}
            <i>ease campus life</i>. It is created with a <i>opensource</i>{' '}
            vision where any JU member is free to contribute and take full
            credits of their work.
            <br />
            We started with an <i>Android app</i> having some basic features
            like providing Mess's Food Menu or helping you navigate across the
            campus. Since then, we never stopped. Our app has evolved. Not only
            app, we have developed a Google Action as well and iOS app is in
            development. Our team also grew. We welcome anyone who has passion
            to create something that is actually used by thousands of people
            daily.
            <br />
            <strong>Our motto</strong> : Deployment of skill or talent you have
            in Real-life is important.

            Everything started with just a simple problem faced on the very
            first day of college. Finding the LT was a headache. That wasn't the
            only problem. We saw how mess admins struggled writing menu on white
            boards. Yeah, those were the days we came from. And we changed that!
            And that was it. We faced problems and solved them using technology
            so that you don't have to face them. But this doesn't mean you just
            keep enjoying our efforts. You are supposed to find out where you
            fit in our team. Try to find out how you can help make this campus a
            better place so that you can change the world in future.
